# PandaJanny
This is my second thing on git.
It's awful, go somewhere else.

# Basic idea
The point of this program is to read metadata from sadpanda gallery names.
If you ever used sadpanda, you noticed the common pattern of including all sort of useful info in gallery names. This includes artist, parodied series, translation etc. These information are separated with brackets in this way:

`(C93) [circle name (artist name)] Gensou Kanojo (Touhou Project) [English] [Translators]`

This program assumes you have downloaded your favorite galleries from sadpanda already and have them all in a single directory. With state-of-the-art regular expression it searches through the directory, collects info from gallery names, and makes them useful.

Except it does not work right now. Don't get your hopes high, but feel free to look at my self-learning process.
