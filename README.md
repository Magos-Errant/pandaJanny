This is pandaJanny, my second thing on git.
It's awful, go somewhere else.

The point of this program is to read metadata from sadpanda gallery names.
If you ever used sadpanda, you noticed they expect users to name each gallery according to a patter, so that they contain useful info on artist, parodied series, translation etc.
This program assumes you have downloaded your favorite galleries from sadpanda already and have them all in a single directory. With state-of-the-art regular expression it searches through the directory, collects info from gallery names, and makes them useful.

Except it does not work right now. Don't get your hopes high, but feel free to look at my self-learning process.
